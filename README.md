# Image Steganography
🕵️‍♂️ Steganography Decoder

A tool for decoding hidden messages or data embedded in images using steganography techniques. This system allows users to extract secret messages, files, or other hidden information encoded in images, providing an easy-to-use interface for decryption and analysis.

🔐 Features

🖼️ Image Decoding: Extract hidden data or messages from image files.

🔑 Multiple Steganography Algorithms: Supports various techniques like LSB (Least Significant Bit), DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform), etc.

📂 File Extraction: Decode embedded files or text that were hidden in the image.

⚡ Fast & Efficient: Optimized for quick extraction without compromising performance.

🛠️ Command-Line Interface: Run the tool with simple CLI commands for automation or integration.

📈 Error Handling: Automatic error detection for unsupported formats or corrupt data.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python (or specify your programming language)

Libraries: Pillow, numpy, stegano, OpenCV, etc.

Algorithms: LSB (Least Significant Bit), DCT, or custom steganography methods.

Output: Extracts text or files as output.

🧪 Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/steganography-decoder.git
cd steganography-decoder


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Usage:

To decode a message hidden in an image, use the command:

python decode.py --image path_to_image.jpg


The decoded message or file will be saved as decoded_output.txt or a corresponding file depending on the hidden data format.

🎯 How It Works

This tool utilizes Least Significant Bit (LSB) encoding, a widely used technique for hiding information in the pixel values of an image. By manipulating the least significant bits of the image's pixel data, secret information can be embedded into an image without significantly altering its appearance.

LSB Encoding: The least significant bit of each pixel's color value is replaced with a bit of the secret message.

Decoding: The tool reads the least significant bits and reconstructs the hidden message or file.

🔄 Supported Formats

Image Formats: PNG, JPEG, BMP, TIFF

Encoded Data Types: Text, binary files, or any data represented in base64 format.

📷 Example Usage
Decode Text Message:
python decode.py --image secret_image.png


Output:

Decoded message: "The hidden treasure is buried at the old oak tree."

Decode a Hidden File:
python decode.py --image secret_image_with_file.png


Output:

The hidden file 'secret_document.pdf' has been extracted.
